# A note for our professor grading this
At the time we submitted the URL for grading, we're still having trouble with getting code from Emily's computer. We're trying to work on it because the solution we got from the TA worked for me, but not for her so that was a lovely surprise. If this message isn't gone, here's proof that Emily wrote and added to the code: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/393911988184416256/762524594744852480/image0.jpg

# What does the code do?
The file titled Untitled has the actual program. This program will ask the user for their name. If they put in something that isn't a name, like a number, the program will tell them that's not a name and refer to them as "user." It will then ask the user for the year they were born. By subtracting the year the user was born from 2020, it will calculate how old the user is. It gives two values: the upperlimit for if you've already had your birthday, and the lowerlimit if you haven't had your birthday yet. It will then print "Hello (name)! You are (upperlimit) years old or (lowerlimit) years old if you haven't had your birthday yet. Happy early birthday!"

The code at the top printing "hjonk hjonk am goose" is purely a joke from when we were testing how GitHub works. It has no relation to the program.

Please also disregard the file titled group project. I've tried deleting it multiple times and it won't go away.

# What's up with the license?
Our license agreement is relatively loose, this is a relatively small and simple program after all. It's here to protect our place as creators of this code, requires that credit is given where it's due, and lets other people tinker with and use it in their own code.

# Code of conduct?
We want this code to be able to be used by everyone. That means that this needs to be a welcoming environment for all people to interact, regardless of differences. There needs to be no hate towards any group of people, politeful and respectful conduct among contributors, and no sexual or explicit comments as there could be minors using this software.

# How do I use this code?
Simple! You just need access to Jupyterhub or another server that runs Python. If you have jupyter, you should be able to access the notebook after cloning it over from Github. If you have any other software that runs Python, you'll have to copy the cells from the program into your own file in Python. The Jupyterhub method is recommended.
